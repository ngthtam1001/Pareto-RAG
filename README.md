## Pareto-RAG

**Pareto‑RAG** is a sentence–entity hybrid retrieval strategy designed to maintain **high recall under a strict token budget**.  
Inspired by the research presented in [Pareto RAG: Selective Retrieval for Efficient Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08178), this repository serves as an **experimental implementation of Pareto‑RAG on the HotpotQA dataset** (using the first 300 questions from the validation set).
